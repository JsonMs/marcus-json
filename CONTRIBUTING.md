# Contributing

## Submit a Pull Request
Please submit a PR broken down into small changes bit by bit. A PR consisting of a lot features and code changes may be hard to review. It is recommended to submit PRs in an incremental fashion.
There are three steps to submitting a pull request:
1. Fork the project to your local repository
2. Save your local changes
3. Send your changes to your fork
4. Open a pull request

## Report issues
It is a great way to contribute by reporting an issue. Well-written and complete bug reports are always welcome! Please open an issue and follow the template to fill in required information.

Before opening any issue, please look up the existing issues to avoid submitting a duplication. If you find a match, you can "subscribe" to it to get notified on updates. If you have additional helpful information about the issue, please leave a comment.

When reporting issues, always include:

- Which version you are using.
- Steps to reproduce the issue.
- Snapshots or log files if needed

Because the issues are open to the public, when submitting files, be sure to remove any sensitive information, e.g. user name, password, IP address, and company name. You can replace those parts with "REDACTED" or other strings like "****".
